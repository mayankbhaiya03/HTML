        Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under
        certain circumstances. When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of
        mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. However, several subatomic
        particles called neutrons are also emitted
    </div>
    <div>during this process. Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process. This
        causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This energy is converted into heat which expands
        uncontrollably causing an explosion. Hence, atoms do not literally explode. They generate energy that can cause
        explosions.
